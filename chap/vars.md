# Instance, Class and Global Variables

## Get and set instance variables for an object

These operations are analogous to `Kernel#instance_variable_get` and
`Kernel#instance_variable_set` in MRI. In other words, they have nothing to
do with an object's _attributes_, that is, whatever instance variables are
made public with the help of getter and setter methods like those provided
by `attr_reader` and `attr_accessor`.
