# Preface

This book is intended for the intermediate to advanced programmer with a
reasonable grasp of both Ruby and C. It also assumes the reader has at least
an informal exposure to the notion of embedded scripting languages and what
is meant by a "host program" in this context. However, this book does _not_
assume that the reader has already used the traditional Ruby/C API that
comes with "Matz's Ruby Interpreter" (MRI). Readers who come from a Tcl or
Lua background will feel especially at home and be able to dive right into
the code examples.
